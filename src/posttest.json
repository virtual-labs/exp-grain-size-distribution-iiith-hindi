			"question": "1. The uniformity coefficient (C<sub>u</sub>) of soil is ____.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "<1",
				"b": "=1",
				"c": ">1",
				"d": ">=1"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "This is impossible as when we apply this condition on the formula D<sub>60</sub> / D<sub>10</sub>, it implies that D<sub>60</sub> < D<sub>10</sub>, i.e, 60% of the soil particles are finer for a smaller size than the size for which 10% of the particles are finer which is not possible.",
				"b": "While this is possible (as D<sub>60</sub> can equal D<sub>10</sub>), it is not the only possibility and does not account for a large number of cases where C<sub>u</sub> is not 1.",
				"c": "While this is possible (as D<sub>60</sub> can be greater than D<sub>10</sub>), it is not the only possibility and does not account for a specific corner case.", 
				"d": "This is the right relation as D<sub>60</sub> can be greater than or equal to D<sub>10</sub>."

			"question": "2. Sieve analysis is used when the size of particles is ____.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "> 0.075mm",
				"b": "< 0.075mm",
				"c": "4.75mm",
				"d": "0.01mm "
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "It is possible to design sieves for sizes > 75 micron and this method helps when the particles have varying sizes.",
				"b": "It is difficult to design sieves for sizes smaller than 75 micron and hence turns out to be ineffective in this case.",
				"c": "When most/all of the particles have the same size, sieve analysis is ineffective.",
				"d": "When most/all of the particles have the same size, sieve analysis is ineffective."

		{
			"question": "3. For coarse grained soil, the particle size D<sub>10</sub> is sometimes called as ____.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Effective size and effective diameter",
				"b": "Uniform diameter",
				"c": "All of the above",
				"d": "None of the above"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "D<sub>10</sub> size is termed as effective particle size as it means that only 10% particles are finer than that size and 90% are coarser.",
				"b": "This is an incorrect name and is counter intuitive for the definition of D<sub>10</sub>.",
				"c": "D<sub>10</sub> size isn't called by both of the above names simultaneously, i.e, it is called either one or none, but not both.",
				"d": "One of the other options contains the correct name for D<sub>10</sub> particle size."

		{
			"question": "4. A soil having a uniformity coefficient smaller than about 2 is considered uniformly graded.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "True",
				"b": "False"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "The uniformity coefficient (C<sub>u</sub>) value is less than 4 for poorly/uniformly graded soil, more than 4 for well graded gravel and more than 6 for well graded sand. Higher value of C<sub>u</sub> indicates that the soil mass consists of soil particles with different size ranges.",
				"b": "The uniformity coefficient (C<sub>u</sub>) value is less than 4 for poorly/uniformly graded soil, more than 4 for well graded gravel and more than 6 for well graded sand. Higher value of C<sub>u</sub> indicates that the soil mass consists of soil particles with different size ranges."
